    <h1><u>Air pollution</u></h1>
    <p>Air pollution is the presence of substances in the air that are harmful to humans, other living beings or the environment. Pollutants can be gases, like ozone or nitrogen oxides, or small particles like soot and dust. Both outdoor and indoor air can be polluted.

Outdoor air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels for electricity and transport, wildfires, some industrial processes, waste management, demolition and agriculture. Indoor air pollution is often from burning firewood or agricultural waste for cooking and heating. Other sources of air pollution include dust storms and volcanic eruptions. Many sources of local air pollution, especially burning fossil fuels, also release greenhouse gases that cause global warming. However air pollution may limit warming locally.

Air pollution kills 7 or 8 million people each year. It is a significant risk factor for a number of diseases, including stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and lung cancer. Particulate matter is the most deadly, both for indoor and outdoor air pollution. Ozone affects crops, and forests are damaged by the pollution that causes acid rain. Overall, the World Bank has estimated that welfare losses (premature deaths) and productivity losses (lost labour) caused by air pollution cost the world economy over $8 trillion per year.

Various technologies and strategies reduce air pollution. Key approaches include clean cookers, fire protection, improved waste management, dust control, industrial scrubbers, electric vehicles and renewable energy. National air quality laws have often been effective, notably the 1956 Clean Air Act in Britain and the 1963 US Clean Air Act. International efforts have had mixed results: the Montreal Protocol almost eliminated harmful ozone-depleting chemicals, while international action on climate change has been less successful.</p>
